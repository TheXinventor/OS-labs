Parallel Speedup = Sequential time/Parallel time
    = 79/46
    = 1.717391304...
    ~ 1.717

The parallel speedup is close to 2 because the parallel solution splits the problem into 2 threads, each with half the inputs - and thus processing time - of the sequential solution. However, it is actually slightly less than 2, as creating the threads requires an extra overhead of processing time in the parallel solution.
