Experiment 6 runs faster than exercise 5, but the final thread count is inaccurate. This is likely due to exp5 implementing mutual exclusion - the process takes longer as both threads have to check on and wait for each other, but the race condition is removed. The extra time is probably why the thread count has been reduced to a hundred million per thread - 2 billion mutually exclusive operations would take too long
